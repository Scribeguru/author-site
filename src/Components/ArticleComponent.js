                body: 'If you haven\'t figured it out yet, this is my blog. The reason it\'s designed so... what most might insist abhorrently — without any dedicated features to share or track the various entries, is twofold.<br><br>...Maybe threefold.<br><br>The second reason is because the year is 2023 and I refuse to believe it\'s the case that people actually read blogs — much less those of the meandering, philosophical variety. The first reason is because it\'s MINE, and I do what I please. The third reason is because for all the petty "merits" a blog offers an author, I\'ve been made to understand the virtue of a custom that does not so easily (as the others) crumple beneath the gravity of the fact I\'m piloting a pretentious sort of public journal.<br><br>That\'s that before expecting anyone to invest their time and money into my book, it\'s good manners to render myself bare in little snippets like this; these dice are my faithful attempt to prove I am sufficiently literate to string words together in a way that isn\'t viscerally offensive to the good, scrupulous grammarians of the English-speaking internet. That, however, is absolutely extraneous to the matter of the blog\'s organization, and alas I find the sole option of an unguided dive into all of what I might feel like presenting here, infinitely favorable. With no temporal or thematic framework to bind these contributions into any sort of linear progression, it\'s impossible for me to exercise less than complete diligence as I paint the many sides of these dice. The early days and the later days shall all be judged as one.<br><br>Do take care!'
